# Anagram and Phrase Anagram Solver

This project explores solving single-word and multi-word phrase anagrams. It also includes a thematic Voldemort challenge, using cryptanalytical techniques to uncover the hidden name. Advanced techniques like digrams, trigrams, and CV mapping were employed to optimize the process.

## Project Overview

### Single-Word Anagrams

The project begins with the implementation of `anagrams.py`, a script to find all valid single-word anagrams for a given input using a dictionary.

### Phrase Anagrams

Building on the single-word solution, `phrase_anagrams.py` handles multi-word anagrams. The script allows users to:

- Generate partial anagrams.
- Validate whether generated words are meaningful.
- Select words interactively to form phrases.

Example: The input "Bill Bo" produces the phrase anagram "ill Bob".

### Voldemort Anagram Challenge

Using brute-force and cryptanalytical techniques, the Voldemort challenge solves a complex anagram using:

1. **CV Mapping**: Maps consonants and vowels for efficient filtering.
2. **Digrams and Trigrams**: Uses least-likely trigrams and digrams to refine the search space.
3. **Permutation-Based Search**: Brute-forces potential solutions and allows user input for leftover letters.
