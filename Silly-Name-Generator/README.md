## Project Overview

The primary goal of this chapter is to create a **random pseudonym generator** using Python. The project evolves through multiple iterations:

1. **`pseudonyms.py`** - The initial implementation of the pseudonym generator.
2. **`pseudonyms_main.py`** - Refactored to include a proper `main()` function.
3. **`pseudonyms_main_fixed.py`** - Final version, ensuring compliance with PEP8, PEP257, and pylint standards.

Additional tools and concepts introduced:

- Python style guides: PEP8, PEP257.
- Code analysis with `pylint`.
- Writing clear and descriptive docstrings.

## Files in Chapter 1

1. **`pseudonyms.py`**: The initial version of the pseudonym generator.
2. **`pseudonyms_main.py`**: Refactored to include a proper entry point (`main` function).
3. **`pseudonyms_main_fixed.py`**: Final version with style and code quality fixes.
4. **`pig_Latin_practice.py`**: A script for practicing Pig Latin translation.
5. **`ETAOIN_practice.py`**: Implements the "Poor Man's Bar Chart" project.

## Key Learnings

- **Pseudocode:** Writing a structured plan before implementing code.
- **Style Guides:** Understanding the importance of Python standards:
  - PEP8: Style Guide for Python Code.
  - PEP257: Conventions for writing docstrings.
- **Code Checking Tools:** Using `pylint` to analyze and improve code quality.
- **Refactoring:** Iteratively improving code for readability and maintainability.

## Practice Projects

1. **Pig Latin Translator:**
   - File: `pig_Latin_practice.py`
   - Description: Converts user input into Pig Latin.

2. **Poor Man's Bar Chart:**
   - File: `ETAOIN_practice.py`
   - Description: Creates a basic frequency-based bar chart from text input.
