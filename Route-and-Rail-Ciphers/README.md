# Decoding American Civil War Ciphers

This project explores two classic ciphers used during the American Civil War: the Route Cipher and the Rail Fence Cipher. It provides Python implementations for both encryption and decryption, allowing you to experiment with these historical ciphers and understand their underlying principles. It also includes practice projects for identifying cipher types and cracking them using brute-force techniques.

## Project Overview

### Route Cipher

The project implements the Route Cipher, a transposition cipher that rearranges letters in a grid pattern. The `route_cipher_decrypt.py` and `route_cipher_hacker.py` scripts demonstrate decryption and code-breaking techniques for this cipher.

### Rail Fence Cipher

The Rail Fence Cipher, another transposition cipher, is implemented with `rail_fence_cipher_encrypt.py` and `rail_fence_cipher_decrypt.py`. These scripts showcase encryption and decryption processes.

### Practice Projects

The project includes practice projects like `identify_cipher_type_practice.py`, `key_dictionary_practice.py`, and `permutations_practice.py`. These explore identifying cipher types, storing keys as dictionaries, and automating key generation for brute-force attacks.
